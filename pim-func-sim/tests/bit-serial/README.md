## Bit-serial Performance Modeling

This module demonstrates how each bit-serial PIM device implements high-level functional APIs.

Detailed micro-ops stats are collected for functional performance and energy modeling.

Code organization:
* bsMain: Main entry to run all tests
* bsBase: Base class with common code and virtual APIs
* Each device has separate h/cc files
